### 🛒 The challenge is to build a catalog view for a loyalty program app. <br> 📢 The product’s main goal is to help users redeem items through a points-based system.

➡ Each product should have a visible price in points. <br>
➡ The user should be able to sort products by price, from highest to lowest, and vice-versa. <br>
➡ The user should be able to see how many points they have in their account. <br>
➡ There should be a clear way for the user to distinguish those products that they can redeem from those they cannot. <br>
➡ A “Redeem” button should be available for those products that the user has enough points to claim. <br>
➡ A “Redeem now” option should appear when the user interacts with a product that they have enough points to claim. <br>
➡ When the user doesn’t have enough points for a product, they should be able to see how many more points they need to claim it. <br>
➡ The user should not be able to redeem a product for which they don’t have enough points. <br>
➡ When the user clicks on the Redeem now button, the system should automatically deduct the item’s price from the users’ points.
